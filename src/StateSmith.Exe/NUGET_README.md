# [StateSmith](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith)
StateSmith is a cross platform, free/open source tool for generating state machines. The generated code is human readable, has zero dependencies and is suitable for use with tiny bare metal microcontrollers, kernels, or servers. It avoids dynamic memory allocations for the safety or performance inclined.
