# Welcome!

This example uses new StateSmith features that are really helpful:
1. draw.io vscode plugin.
2. C# script files.

While you don't have to use StateSmith with vscode (you can go pure CLI),
it is really handy.

# Install instructions 📦
Install `dotnet` and `dotnet-script`:
https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/StateSmith-install-requirements

## (Optional) draw.io 🖉
You'll also want to install the `draw.io` vscode extension:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio

## (Optional) Intellisense 🔍
To get intellisense for our C# scripts, install the official C# vscode extension:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp

You'll also need to run a few terminal commands for vscode to understand C# script files:

```
dotnet script init delete_me_dummy_file.csx
rm ./delete_me_dummy_file.csx
```

Then restart vscode and you should be good to go!
