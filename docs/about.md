## PR message
Title: 

This PR addresses various onboarding usability challenges for new statesmith users.
You can preview the new documentation here: https://emmby.github.io/StateSmith/

#### Documentation is consolidated onto GitHub Pages.
Previously, documentation was a mix
of GitHub Docs, Pages, and Wiki. This made it hard to find content, resulted in parts
of things being documented in the wiki and other parts in docs, etc. The Wiki was difficult
to maintain and Docs was not as flexible as Pages. 

Using Pages enabled us to customize, doing things like:
* add a navigation sidebar
* embed *.puml and generated *.svg files directly into the page
* embed the simulator directly into the page as an iframe

It also makes documentation much easier to maintain and update than the Wiki. Anyone can submit a documentation
update along with the rest of their PR.

#### Interactive, up to date examples

The examples in the documentation are generated by statesmith so they're always showing the latest code. By embedding
the simulator, we can also make them interactive.

#### Simplifed onboarding.

Statesmith is powerful. As a new user, it can be very challenging to figure out how to get started. The new ss.cli helps, but even so it's still hard to get started. There are a great many excellent examples, but it can be hard to find the right ones at the right times.

The new onboarding documentation builds on the simplification work we landed in 2024. Most examples require no configuration, and thus all the complexities of CSX are deferred until later in the tutorial.

Each section demonstrates a feature of statesmith with a clear, interactive example using the new simulator.

The advanced usage information is still available for power users or users with specific needs (eg. low memory usage for microcontrollers), and is hopefully easier to find.

#### A simplified, posix style build tool.
ss.cli is a powerful shell-like tool that is interactive driven first, and xxx second

we introduce an alternative tool that is less powerful, but more familiar to developers who commonly use build tooling. statesmith is intended to drop into any build system (Arduino IDE, GitHub actions, makefiles, ant, maven, node, etc.) and be easy to use from any shell. as such, it is non-interactive beyond the command line.

users can continue to use ss.cli for more advanced usage at any time.

#### A focus on integrating with familiar tools.
xxx
meet the users where they are. support popular package managers via github actions
github integration documentation.

#### Other notes

* Examples are embedded directly into the documentation. Similar to mermaid, but using PlantUML instead.
* Make PlantUML work out of the box https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/438
* Documentation looks good in dark and light modes






## TODO
* fix the hero graphic on main page
* use the current binary, not a hardcoded downloaded binary
* package manager support
* google analytics support to track broken pages
* Add a link to allow readers to file feedback bugs in the footer
* Force makefiles to run before github pages are generated
* open the sidebar for the current section
