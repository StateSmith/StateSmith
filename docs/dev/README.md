This directory has documentation on how to develop StateSmith.

Pull Requests are welcome for improving this documentation.

Recommended Reading Order:
1. [build requirements](./build-requirements.md)
2. [build with cli](./build-with-cli.md)
3. [run custom `ss.cli`](./ss.cli-run.md)

After those, it depends on what your goals are:
* If you want to work on the StateSmith core lib, see the the `lib-*.md` files.
* If you want to improve `ss.cli`, see the other `ss.cli-*.md` files.
