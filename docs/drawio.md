# Creating Diagrams with draw.io

StateSmith can work with regular draw.io diagrams, but we recommend loading our custom draw.io plugin. It adds some very useful features.


# Add StateSmith plugin to draw.io application
1. If you haven't already installed the draw.io offline app, download it from [draw.io github releases](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/).
2. Download [StateSmith-drawio.plugin js file](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/releases).
3. Add [plugin to draw.io](https://youtu.be/04EShKOB96c?si=riFi3U9YcWOBYARH&t=112).

> We recommend using the draw.io app. However, adventurous users may choose to use the draw.io VS Code plug-in instead.
> It provides a convenient workflow for VS Code users but has some bugs that prevent us from recommending it
> for new users.
