First read the [Contributing](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/Contributing) page and get the [unit tests running](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/Building-Source-and-Running-Tests).

Before starting work, please open a ticket so that we can plan out the work.

# Grammar Work
Follow the instructions at https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/main/antlr/README.md

## Add More Elements to Ignore 
To add more items to the grammar that we should ignore, open [PlantUML.g4](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/main/antlr/PlantUML.g4). This is an ANTLR4 grammar file.

Find the the `ignore:` parse rule and update it as needed:

## Update Wiki
Please remind us that we need to also update the [PlantUML wiki page](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/PlantUML). If you are interested in helping keep the wiki up to date, let me know.
