## Web/UI Help
I could really use help improving the [StateSmith-drawio-plugin](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/issues). I enjoy doing web stuff, but I'm not very proficient at it. I would be super pumped to have a few web people join the team. It doesn't need to be a large time commitment. Even helping with relatively small issues or providing guidance would be great.

## C#/Core Help
If you know C#, I would love some [help here](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Or anywhere that you are interested.

## Let's grow a community!
StateSmith is pretty decent right now. The internals have been heavily refactored and are ready for contributors to start hacking on and improving.  I'll be shifting my focus from developing features on my own to supporting contributors.

I'll be publishing video tutorials for end users as well as core contributors soon.

In the meantime, give [How StateSmith Works](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/How-StateSmith-Works) a read and explore the various information in this wiki and the other [StateSmith repos](https://github.com/StateSmith).
