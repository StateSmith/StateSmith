Hi everyone,

I've been working hard on StateSmith and have lots of great updates to share!

This is a long list so feel free to skip around, but make sure to checkout the bottom for some upcoming tutorials.

# New CLI Tool - `ss.cli` üöÄ
Create new projects and generate code in seconds! This is a massive time-saver for developers.

Common commands:
- `ss.cli create` - this will bring up a wizard that guides you through quickly creating a new StateSmith project. It remembers your choices for the next time you run the command so you should only need to enter in the project name and then hit enter a few times to create a new project.
- `ss.cli run` - generate code for your state machines.

# Pre-built Binaries or Install üì¶
There are two main ways to run the StateSmith CLI:

1. Download the pre-built binary for your computer.
    * No need to install anything.
    * Doesn't require dotnet SDK.
1. Install the StateSmith CLI using the dotnet SDK.
    * Recommended if you already have a dotnet SDK (6,7,8) installed.
    * Smallest, fastest, and simplest.
    * Easy to update.

Pre-built binaries are available for the following platforms:
- Windows: `x64`, `x86`, `arm64`
- Linux: `x64`, `arm`, `arm64`, `musl-x64`, `musl-arm64`
- OSX: `x64`, `arm64`

# New Supported Languages üåç
We now support Python 3.10+ and Java! This brings the total number of supported languages to 6. More to come...

1. ‚úÖ Python 3.10+ - `NEW!`
2. ‚úÖ Java - `NEW!`
3. ‚úÖ JavaScript
4. ‚úÖ C#
5. ‚úÖ C++ (although still C style - not idiomatic yet)
6. ‚úÖ C99


<br>

# Multiple Algorithms üß†
One of my favorite features of StateSmith is that it is very flexible.

I just added another state machine algorithm to StateSmith giving us a total of 2 algorithms to choose from right now.

`Balanced2` is the new default algorithm. It is a variant of `Balanced1`. Instead of dynamically updating function pointers, `Balanced2` uses a more traditional switch/case mapping.

Pros:
- minimal RAM usage (as low as 1 byte per state machine instance)
- looks more like hand written state machine code (easier to follow)

## Support Matrix
Not all algorithms are supported for all languages. Here is the current support matrix. Improvements are coming.

# Interactive Simulator üéÆ
We now have a simulator that allows you to easily interact with your state machine. Super useful for learning StateSmith features and quickly checking designs.

<br>


# Single Diagram File üìÑ
StateSmith used to require two files for every project (a diagram file and a script file for settings).

Now you can put everything in the diagram file (draw.io and PlantUML).

The original script file (.csx) method is still supported and is useful for more advanced settings.



<br>


# draw.io Improvements üí™
We've made draw.io a lot easier to use and added new features.

## Easier to Use
Previously, states needed to be nested inside of a `$STATEMACHINE` shape, but now you can declare states anywhere on the page. This makes it much easier to create and modify state machine diagrams.

## Multiple Pages & New Templates
You can now have multiple pages in your draw.io file. This is useful for organizing your diagrams and keeping things clean.

When `ss.cli` generates you a new `draw.io` file, it creates 3 pages for you:
1. state machine diagram
2. configuration
3. template shapes and help info

### Config Page
The settings use TOML. [More info here](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/main/docs/settings.md).

### Shapes & Tips Page
This page contains shapes that you can use in your diagram. It also contains tips and tricks for using draw.io. This makes it easy to use draw.io without the StateSmith draw.io plugin.

# PlantUML Improvements üå±
We've made additional improvements to PlantUML support.

Some of the biggest news here is that we now have a lot more learning resources for PlantUML + StateSmith.

# New Tutorials
The below tutorials use new StateSmith features that are more user friendly. They use different diagram tools, but mirror each other fairly closely otherwise.

- [Tutorial-3](https://github.com/StateSmith/tutorial-3) - `PlantUML` `CLI` `text`
- [Tutorial-4](https://github.com/StateSmith/tutorial-4) - `draw.io` `CLI` `text & üé• video series`

# More Tutorials Coming üìö
Lots of fun tutorials coming soon to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@statesmith

## Video Games
### Enemy "AI"
This is a fun one! I'm pretty new to game development, but it is actually quite similar to robotics. I'll be doing a small mini series on enemy "AI" using state machines with the LittleJS game engine.

I currently have 4 "AI" levels:

- `dumber than dumb`
- `timed hunting`
- `special attack`
- `coordinating` - enemy blobs get sleepy, sleep, dance, get surprised, call for help, hunt, charge attack, celebrate... They still need to run away from grenades though.

The `coordinating` "AI" blobs cover a lot of cool features of StateSmith and are really fun to experiment with :)

Below image is a video.

### Character states
One of the classic uses cases of state machines in video games.

## Robotics
### Sassy robots
This robot doesn't take crap from anyone. See video below.

A webots simulation showing rudimentary control of a robot with StateSmith. One interesting aspect is that we have different types of state machines cooperating (some using StateSmith, some hand coded). The robot has a number of linear "sequence" state machines that are hand coded. You could use StateSmith for that as well, but I find StateSmith is more useful for non-linear and hierarchical state machines.

Below image is a video.

## Embedded
### Nerf Sentry
Simple Nerf Sentry design. It has a few modes: auto, manual, disabled. In auto mode it sweeps back and forth until a target is found. Then it begins firing, does a quick sweep forward by 25 degrees, reverses direction for 50 degrees, then stops firing. The basic idea is that when a target is found, we spray the area with the hope of hitting something. Planning on using some pretty cheap sensors :)

### Bespoke Button Debouncing
A tutorial on how to use StateSmith to create custom button debouncing and event detection (press, release, hold, hold repeat, ...). The idea is to help people generate button state machines that do just what they need.

This would actually be pretty nice. Right now, there are two basic types of button libraries: super basic (which often lack desired features), and heavy weight (which have way too much and use a ton of RAM).

### PlantUML Menu Generation
One of the really cool things about supporting PlantUML is that we can easily create tools to generate PlantUML state machines and still have the ability to easily customize them.

For example, I'm working on a tool where you input text like this:
```
MAIN_MENU
    CURRENT_TIME
    SOLAR_STATS
        SOLAR_STATS_1
        SOLAR_STATS_2
            SS2_VOLTAGE
            SS2_CURRENT
        SOLAR_STATS_3
    BATTERY_STATS
        BATTERY_STATS_1
        BATTERY_STATS_2
        BATTERY_STATS_3
```

and the tool spits out a PlantUML state machine diagram that can still be easily customized.
