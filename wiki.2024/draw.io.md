# ðŸ“¢ Common Beginner Issue ðŸ“¢
Most beginners will run into the issue of draw.io showing nodes as grouped when they actually aren't.

See https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/Troubleshooting#non-related-nodes-overlap

# File Choice
StateSmith recognizes the following file extensions as draw.io files:
* `.drawio` (regular xml) - generally works better. **Recommended.**
* `.drawio.svg` (encoded xml)
* `.dio` (regular xml)

Which to choose? See page [draw.io file choice](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/draw.io:-file-choice).

<br> 



# draw.io UI Choice
You can use draw.io online, the draw.io offline app, draw.io for vscode, or even draw.io for confluence.

You'll probably want to use either the draw.io offline app or vscode. Both have their advantages ([more info](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/wiki/)).

# Requires StateSmith v0.7.3+
StateSmith [v0.7.3](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/v0.7.3-alpha/CHANGELOG.md#073-alpha) added support for draw.io files.

# [StateSmith-drawio-plugin](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/wiki/)
The core StateSmith library that reads draw.io files does not require use of this plugin. It can be handy though.

# Using draw.io without the plugin
Latest `ss.cli` template has a draw.io page with template shapes.

Here's a [template](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=StateSmith%20Template.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1yLK0es2Jf9LB6FRSt3loK6Pkxe8vlxo0%26export%3Ddownload) with some shapes you can use if you like. You don't have to use these shapes though.

You can use your own custom shapes as long as the shape labels match what StateSmith expects. See [restrictions on styling](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/draw.io:-styling-restrictions).

Also see this [discussion](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/111) regarding using UML 2.5 shapes.

# Restrictions on styling âš 
You can style the draw.io shapes however you want. StateSmith doesn't care **EXCEPT** for some [special text nodes](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/draw.io:-styling-restrictions).
