## New Tutorials
The below tutorials use new StateSmith features that are more user friendly. They use different diagram tools, but mirror each other fairly closely otherwise.

- [Tutorial-3](https://github.com/StateSmith/tutorial-3) - `PlantUML` `CLI` `text lessons`
- [Tutorial-4](https://github.com/StateSmith/tutorial-4) - `draw.io` `CLI` `text lessons` `ðŸŽ¥ video series`

## Old Resources
[Tutorial-2](https://github.com/StateSmith/tutorial-2) uses the older method of C# script (.csx) files which are still actively supported. The .csx approach is more complicated, but also enables advanced features and deep customization for power users. Tutorial 2 also uses **draw.io**. <br>`draw.io` `.csx` `requires dotnet install` <br>
