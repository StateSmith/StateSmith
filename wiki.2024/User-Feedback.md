Before StateSmith can hit version 1.0, we need more community feedback.

# Share Your Perspective and Use Cases
This is going to continue to be more and more important as we add support for more languages. My main perspective is writing C code for embedded microcontrollers. I can guess what a web or other dev might want in a state machine, but I really need some core members to help guide and shape the development of StateSmith.

You don't need to write any code.

Special thanks to [iamjuing](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues?q=author%3Aiamjuing). His c/c++ guidance has been very helpful.
