# Breaking Changes Are Rare ðŸŒ±
It's been a long time since we've had a breaking change. We do our best to avoid and minimize breaking changes.

That said, we will may occasionally have to make changes to StateSmith that may affect your projects.

You can easily find changes by searching for `"### Changed"` or `BREAKING-CHANGES` in the [changelog markdown file](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1). I do my best to detail any required migration steps. Ask if you need help.

# Stability ðŸŒ‰
The above might sound a bit scary, but the situation isn't that bad. I just want to be fully transparent.

We have a slew of state machine behavior specification tests to help ensure we don't accidentally break state machine behavior or make them lightly.

### Added
- `RunnerSettings.filePathPrintBase` to control how file paths are printed.
  - Required when C# scripts (.csx) are used.
  - https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/79

## [0.7.3-alpha]
### Added
- draw.io - add support for draw.io plugin and new drawing style where a state can have its text event handlers as a child text node instead of its label #77.
  - see `src/StateSmithTest/test-input/drawio/Design1Sm.drawio.svg` or expand section below
  - https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/77
  - child text must have matching style elements (in any order): `fillColor=none;gradientColor=none;strokeColor=none;resizable=0;movable=0;deletable=0;rotatable=0;`
    - this is already done if you use the plugin https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin

## [0.7.2-alpha]
### Added
- draw.io - embedded images inside of a draw.io diagram are now ignored. Issue #77.
  - images are sometimes embedded in state machine diagrams for documentation purposes.
- draw.io - treat null labels as blank instead of throwing exception. Null labels don't normally occur. Issue #77.
- improved `$notes` validations.

---

## [0.7.1-alpha]
### Added
- Add initial support for draw.io files as alternative to yEd files. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/77
  - Supported file extensions:
    - `.drawio.svg` Recommended as design file is a valid svg image that can be used in markdown and other files!
    - `.drawio`
    - `.dio`

---

## [0.7.0-alpha]
### Changed
- Generated .h file now automatically includes `<stdint.h>` (required for history states).

### Added
- Add history. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/63
  - Deep history functionality supported via history continue nodes.
  - plantuml supports history states and history continue nodes.
- Add `$prefix` methods.
  - Experimental feature to help with duplicate state names. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/65

### Fixed
  - Pseudo state transition de-duplication now considers initial state parent incoming transition count too.
  - Improved exit handling optimization.

---

## [0.6.1-alpha]
### Added
- Improve generated code clarity by showing step 1,2,3... and other small things.
- Improve generated code clarity by removing `if (true)` for behaviors with no guard clause.
- Improve generated code by nulling `ancestor_event_handler` only when actually needed. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/14
- Throw helpful exception message when duplicate state name used. Previously relied on c compiler and user to catch the problem.
```
VertexValidationException: Duplicate state name `OPTION` also used by state `Statemachine{LaserTagMenu1Sm}.State{MENUS_GROUP}.State{MAIN_MENU}.State{OPTION}`.
    Vertex
    Path: Statemachine{LaserTagMenu1Sm}.State{MENUS_GROUP}.State{MM_SHOW_INFO}.State{OPTION}
    Diagram Id: n0::n3::n2::n2
    Children count: 0
    Behaviors count: 3
    Incoming transitions count: 2
```

## [0.6.0-alpha]
### Fixed
- Fix parent self transition involving initial state incorrect https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/49
- StateSmith grammar fix for parsing 'e()'. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/60

### Changed
- Transition actions are now run after states are exited (instead of before) https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/6
- Reserved `else` "trigger" name for `else` functionality https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/59

### Added
- Support `$choice` pseudo states/points https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/40
  - supported in PlantUML as well.
- Support multiple transitions for initial states, entry points, exit points. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/40
  - Allow multiple transitions from initial state.
  - Initial state must have a default transition (always true).
  - Allow incoming transitions to initial state.
  - Allow multiple transitions from entry point.
  - Entry point must have a default transition (always true).
  - Allow incoming transitions to entry point.
  - Allow multiple transitions from exit point.
  - Exit point must have a default transition (always true).
- Allow specifying `else` on transitions https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/59
- Optimize pseudo state transitions to avoid code duplication.
  - Especially important for when History states are eventually implemented as the code de-duplication
  savings can rack up big there.
- Improve entry and exit point validations.
  - Detect duplicate labels in the same scope.
  - Allow exit points to target parent state. Same as a self transition on parent.
- grammar - support backtick strings and other ASCII symbols https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/42

## [0.5.9-alpha]
### Added
- Runner - set process exit code to -1 on failure.
- Runner - output additional exception details to `<diagram_file_path>.err.txt`.
  This is useful for generic assert like exceptions that don't yet have useful error messages.
  https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/38
- validation - new exception: `State machines must have exactly 1 initial state. Actual count: 0.`
- validation - helpful error messages for when state machine design is not found.
- Add Describe() methods for Behavior and Vertex.
- Add `TracingModder` class and experimental `Runner.postParentAliasValidation()` callback that allows graph modification.

### Fixed
- Root initial transition actions are now output. Had been ignored previously. Other initial transition actions were output properly. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/47
- Parent to child transition now exits current child first. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/46
- Parent to self transition now exits current child first. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/48

---

## [0.5.7-alpha]
### Added
- detect yEd hidden edges https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/29
- Better error reporting regarding diagram edge IDs.
- Improve PlantUML parsing https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/21
  - `notes`, and improve parsing of malformed `skinparam` blocks.
- Prevent antlr4 error output to console.

### Fixed
- Now throws useful lexer stage exceptions instead of printing them and not recognizing the failure. https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/31 

---

## [0.5.6-alpha]
### Added
- Support [PlantUML input](./docs/plantuml-input.md) as an alternative to yEd input.
  Input file extension must be one of ".pu", ".puml", ".plantuml"
  https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/21

---

## [0.5.5-alpha]
### Fixed
- Fix generated comment regarding marking event as handled when not for a transition

---

## [0.5.4-alpha]
### Added
- Support `entry` and `exit` points https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/3

- Improve exception error messages

---

## [0.5.3-alpha]
### Fixed
- Fix generated comment about exiting to LCA name
- Fix `FinishCodeBlock()` when `BracesOnNewLines = false;`
