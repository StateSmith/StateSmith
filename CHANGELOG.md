# Changelog
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

# Breaking Changes ðŸŒ±
We will occasionally make changes to StateSmith that may affect your projects. Help us get to `v1.0` faster!

You can easily find changes by searching for `"### Changed"` in the [changelog markdown file](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1). I do my best to detail any required migration steps. Ask if you need help.

# Stability ðŸŒ‰
The above might sound a bit scary, but the situation isn't that bad. I just want to be fully transparent.

We have a slew of state machine behavior specification tests to help ensure we don't accidentally break state machine behavior or make them lightly.

The majority of our breaking changes have been to code generation scripts (.csx files) as major features are implemented and require rework. Updating the .csx file scripts usually only takes a few minutes. Feel free to ask for help if you have any problems.
